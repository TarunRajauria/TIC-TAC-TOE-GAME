# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. This project is a great way to learn basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Two players take turns to place their marks (`X` or `O`) on the board.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures players enter valid moves (numbers 1-9) and prevents overwriting existing marks.
- **Win Detection**: Checks for a winner after each move (not fully implemented yet).
- **Draw Detection**: Declares a draw if all spaces are filled without a winner.

## How to Play

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. **Run the Game**: Execute the Python script to start the game.
3. **Gameplay**:
   - Player `X` starts first, followed by Player `O`.
   - Enter a number between 1 and 9 to place your mark on the corresponding board position.
   - The board is displayed after each move.
4. **Objective**: Be the first to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
